Wellcome to my Swift Learning Space. I'm not calling it a playground so it doesn't get confused with a Swift Playground.

The intention here is for a small focused screens where I can play with ideas or doing cool things, learn, and then take the learning to other apps. 

List of controls/animations/things to implement:

1) Animating circle in a circular path depending on how fast the drag gesture is.
2) Circular animated progress bar that would work on iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS like what the activity watchOS app does.
3) A custom shape class - at least a triangle.
4) An analog clock view - with hour, minute, and second handles that update correctly without clogging up the system.
5) Carousel/wheel layout - for pictures or custom views with customizations for reuse in apps.
6) Book flipping animation - pass it x number of views and have them show up as pages of a book.
7) Photomosaic view with animated zoom in one any picture you tap on and animated zoom out.

Other things:
1) List of items, with ability to filter and sort. Implement pull to refresh, swipe to delete, add new items.
2) Calendar integration to add items, remove them, and view them.
3) Play a video.
4) Basic SwiftCharts
5) Fancy SwiftCharts
